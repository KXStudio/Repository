Description: LV2 port of Airwindows plugins by Chris Johnson
 Airwindows is a collection of modular, graphic-less, stripped-down audio
 plugins.
 .
 Airwindowsâ€™ reputation was built out of generic-interface plugins, which
 typically focus on doing only one thing, often with very simple controls,
 labelled to help understanding but not to encourage formulaic work.
