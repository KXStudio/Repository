Storing some of the final binaries here, which is needed due to launchpad not allowing:
 - installing i386 packages on x86_64 builders
 - generating i386 packages from a PPA

Either of those would allow carla bridge packaging, but both are not possible and thus we build it outside of PPAs.
Builds are created within a container to help reproducibility, see https://github.com/falkTX/Carla/tree/main/data/docker
